After using emacs for a year I am moving to vim.

Imo, vim +vscode is best for reading code and editing.

Shifting workflow to tmux+vim and vscode.

VScode settings automticlly synced using Github auth.


Current dev setup:

1. Using zsh and tmux for quickly reading and mkaing small changes or for small hobby things.
2. If LOC > 500 , using VScode for the project.
3. Majorly used VScode for web-dev and full-stack projects.
